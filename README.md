# Module-11-challenge

# Introduction
This project involves scraping and analyzing weather data from Mars using the Beautiful Soup library and Pandas in Python. The data is sourced from the Mars Temperature Data Site and provides insights into various aspects of the Martian climate, such as temperature variations and atmospheric pressure.

# Usage
Follow these steps to run the analysis:

Open the Jupyter Notebook part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
Execute the cells step-by-step to scrape, process, and analyze the data.
The data will be stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file named Mars_temps_dataframe.csv.

# Features
Web Scraping: Automated browsing and data scraping from the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Data Processing: Conversion of scraped data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.
Data Analysis: Calculation of average temperatures and pressures by Martian month.
Visualization: Plotting average temperature and pressure trends.

# Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

beautifulsoup4
pandas
matplotlib
splinter

# Documentation
Step-by-Step Guide
Visit the Website: Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Scrape the Table: Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.
Store the Data: Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.
Prepare Data for Analysis: Examine and cast data types to datetime, int, or float as necessary.
Analyze the Data: Use Pandas functions to analyze the dataset and answer specific questions about the Martian weather.
